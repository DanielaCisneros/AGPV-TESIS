                        The story begins as Don Vito Corleone, the head of a New York Mafia family, overseeshis daughter's wedding. His beloved son

                        T hrough Michael's life the nature of the family business becomes clear. The business of the family is
                        just like the head of the family, kind and benevolent to those who give respect, but given to ruthless

                        Francis Ford Coppola's legendary continuation and sequel to his landmark 1972 film, The_Godfather parallels the young Vito
                        Corleone's rise with his son Michael's spiritual fall, deepening The_Godfather's depiction of the dark
                        side of the American dream. In the early 1900s, the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for America
                        after the local Mafia kills his family. Vito struggles to make a living, legally or illegally, for his
                        wife and growing brood in Little Italy, killing the local Black Hand Fanucci after he demands his customary
                        cut of the tyro's business. With Fanucci gone, Vito's communal stature grows.
